# MAT292-Ordinary-Differential-Equations

The focus of MAT292 was on understanding ODEs and learning to model real life situations using them. We did a lot of this analytically but also occasionally on MATLAB using numerical methods. This repository contains the code for the MATLAB labs done throughout this course.

**Plagerism warning:** If you are a student taking this course in the future, don't destroy your learning by copying solutions. At the end of the day, your skills are all you will have.
