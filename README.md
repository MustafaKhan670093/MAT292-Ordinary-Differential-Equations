# MAT292-Ordinary-Differential-Equations

The focus of MAT292 was on understanding ODEs and learning to model real life situations using them. We did a lot of this analytically but also occasionally on MATLAB using numerical methods. This repository contains the code for the MATLAB labs done throughout this course.
